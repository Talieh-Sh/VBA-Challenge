# VBA Stock Market Data Analysis
# Overview
In this project, a VBA code is used to analyze the stock market data. For years 2018 to 2020, Yearly change, Percentage changes, and total stock volume has been extracted and a summary table of the greatest % increase, greatest decrease, and greatest total volume has been shown. Also, conditional formatting was applied for changed columns
